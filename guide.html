<h1>Guide</h1>
<div class="horizontal-line"></div>
<p>If you're reading this, you're probably new here.</p>
<p>This guide contains all essential information you need to know.</p>
<br>
&nbsp;
<p>When you arrive at this site, you may see the <b>Home</b> page, which is</p>
<p>the main section of the site when you arrive.</p>
<br>
<p>On the top you can see the header, which contains a welcoming title</p>
<p>and hyperlinks to pages.</p>
<br>
<p>You are currently in the <b>Guide</b> section, which means you at least</p>
<p>know how to navigate hyperlinks, because without that knowledge,</p>
<p>you probably won't be here without help.</p>
<br>
<p>Click on the <b>Cameras</b> hyperlink. You can see a list of cameras. It is</p>
<p>easy to watch them, just click on their specific button/image. The</p>
<p>buttons also have the camera ID under them, which is sometimes</p>
<p>useful for example going back to the camera later.</p>
<br>
<p>Remember, if you cannot/don't want to pick, just click on the</p>
<p>Random camera hyperlink.</p>
<br>
&nbsp;
<p>Congratulations! You are now watching a camera. You can see:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<center>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the statistics  (how long the camera was running before you</p>
</li>
<p class="nobullet">started watching, the ID, and if it's running)</p>
<li>
<p>•<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chat </b> (only if the camera is located in a Multiplayer game)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</center>
</ul>
<p>The main part is the camera feed itself. If no one is there, either go</p>
<p>back to the <b>Cameras</b> hyperlink and choose another camera, or wait</p>
<p>for any activity.</p>
<br>
<p>If you've chosen a Multiplayer camera, there may be more activity</p>
<p>than in a Singleplayer camera. You can know if it's a Singleplayer</p>
<p>camera if the chat says the player is not in Multiplayer.</p>
